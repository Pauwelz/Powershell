This command has to be used when attempting to cluster SQL-server instances, in Azure, in order to set up a SQL-Server Always On configuration.

This command should ONLY be executed on 1 of the SQL-servers you are attempting to cluster.
Keep in mind that you will have to take the cluster resource offline/online for it take effect.

FYI:
	this command can also be used for any type of service that needs to be clustered.
	For instance: SSO-service.
