This script allows for you to quickly replace all of the password-placeholders (******) that are present in the binding-file after 
exporting these bindings.

The script needs to be told the location of:
 - $configFile: [line 4]
   The filepath of the config-file, containing an overview of the passwords per port.
 - $bindingFile: [line 5]
   The filepath of the binding-file.
